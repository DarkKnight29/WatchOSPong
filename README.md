The popular Pong game for Apple watch 
Hope this helps you give ideas to make amazing games for the apple watch,I had a lot of troubling finding resources to understand on how to make games for apple watch using apple's SpriteKit finally did it this way.
Simply create a Single view App for iPhone and then add Target and choose Apple Watch and choose the game extension and voila it's just as same and easy as designing a spritekit scene for an iPhone app, you may have to compromise on controls though but you can take full advantage of the watch crown and swipe gestures (I did use them in the app in a very comfortable way) to get your work done.
