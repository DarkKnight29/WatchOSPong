The popular Pong game for Apple watch 
Hope this helps you give ideas to make amazing games for the apple watch,I ahd a lot of troubling finding resources to understand on how to make games for apple watch using apple's SpriteKit finally did it this way.
Simply create a Single view App for iPhone and then add Target and choose Apple Watcha and choose the game extension and voila it's just as easy as designing a spritekit scene for a iPhone app, you just have to compromise on controls though you can take full advantage of the watch crown and swipe gestures (I did use them in the app in a very comfortable way).
